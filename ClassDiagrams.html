		<h2>Reflection</h2>
		<p> Creating a class diagram was a significant learning curve for me. Initially, I found it difficult to determine what should be represented as a class. However, after attending the seminar led by Oliver Buckley, I adopted the approach of analysing a scenario and identifying the nouns, which greatly helped in identifying the necessary classes (Buckley, 2024). This strategy provided clarity and ensured that I structured my diagram more effectively.

Next, I struggled with defining the attributes and methods of these classes. It wasn’t until I began working on the diagram that I realised how much I still needed to understand. The class diagram, in particular, felt the most technical, and I did experience some panic as I had left this task until the end. Additionally, I wasn’t fully confident in using constructors, which added to the confusion. To address these challenges, I devoted significant time to researching class diagrams, constructors, attributes, and methods, aiming to fill in the gaps in my knowledge (Buckley, 2024). In hindsight, this process of exploration and learning was invaluable, as it enhanced my understanding of object-oriented programming, particularly as I had to grasp basic concepts.

Reflecting on this process, I can see how my initial class diagram was shaped by a limited understanding of the system. At first, placing the ERP class under ActivityManager seemed like a logical choice due to my lack of clarity on the system’s structure. However, as I delved deeper into the methods and attributes, it became clear that this arrangement didn’t accurately reflect the system’s requirements. Realising this allowed me to refine my design, resulting in a more accurate representation of class responsibilities and relationships. This experience taught me the importance of continuous learning and iteration in the design process, as deeper insights often lead to better decisions and more maintainable software.
